## About the Game

**Dissonance** blends visual novel storytelling with rhythm gameplay.  
You’ll guide a fractured music club through trauma, grief, and performance—where every note matters.  

- Story-rich **5-act arc** with branching outcomes.  
- **Rot Score system**: player choices and performance affect each character’s path.  
- **Puppeteer Mode**: share control of notes with characters as they unravel.  
- Hand-drawn art and animation, original compositions, and a haunting narrative.
